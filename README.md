# PATHFINDERAI 🎯  
An AI-powered agent built using IBM Watsonx.ai to provide **personalized learning pathways** based on students' interests, goals, and current skills. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and IBM Cloud services to guide learners toward meaningful careers with confidence.

## 🧩 Problem Statement  
In the era of abundant digital courses and online learning platforms, students often feel overwhelmed. They struggle to figure out:  
- What should I learn first?  
- Which career track suits me?  
- What resources are best for my goals?

This decision paralysis results in wasted time, mismatched skill development, and low engagement.

## 💡 Proposed Solution  
**PATHFINDERAI** solves this by acting as a smart, conversational learning coach. It interacts with students to:  
- Understand their interests (e.g., Frontend, AI, Cybersecurity)  
- Assess their current skill level  
- Generate a customized, evolving course roadmap  
- Recommend resources from trusted platforms  
- Adjust guidance based on user feedback
